Dr Garth Jones (CHE) gives a seminar on 'Optical spectroscopy: from ultrafast pulses to correlated photons'.

Abstract

In this talk, I will discuss the modern spectroscopic technique of ultrafast 2D optical spectroscopy and how we model these experiments. I will also discuss a range of new possible spectroscopies including photon counting approaches, whereby we can monitor phonon dynamics within open quantum systems via photon/phonon cross correlations, and spectroscopy with entangled photons.
